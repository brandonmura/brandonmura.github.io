            <p style="max-width: 50%">Your motivation is nice but still a bit too general, why are you interested in IT, in programming? What potential do you see in this type of career and why? What makes you interested in this study program in particular?  I recommend you check what interests you most about this type of career and to search for the true motivation that will keep you going throughout the study program. This will be very helpful in difficult situations or challenges that you may encounter during your education.</p>

                <br>
                <p style="max-width: 50%">When looking at your goals after completing your studies, it is nice to see you are interested in becoming a software engineer. Besides working on code, what else do you enjoy in being a software engineer? Why does it appeal to you more than being a programmer? Would you enjoy working in a team? Why programming games is sounding good to you, what about creating other types of applications? I would recommend you try and research more about software engineering but maybe other positions as well just to understand your options, what would you like to do in your day to day? How would you like your role to look like? Look more into the program, what interests you in the courses taught. I also recommend you participate in the ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get more information about different professions in the ICT field.</p>
                
                <br>
                <p style="max-width: 50%">Looking at your personal analysis, it is clear you are aware and thought about your strengths and weaknesses, this is very good and beneficial to understand yourself and to become a better professional in the future. Considering your weakness, its good you are aware of them and ready to work on them. It is normal to be affected by day to day events and emotions, I recommend to make a list for yourself in times you recognize its affecting you negatively. What can you do when your enthusiasm is lower, if you feel distracted? What helped you in the past? Moreover, youll have a personal study career coach (one of the lecturers) that will accompany you, student assistants and study buddies to support you during your studies.
